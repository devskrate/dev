bio: >-
    I'm working as a Software Engineer at Dhan AI, India. I usually work with python, NLP and ML more.
    I felt very comfortable and enthusiastic in fuzzy problem solving and real-time application development. Thus started developing minimal use cases as projects which help people around me.
    I'm one of the 1922 candidates who have cleared Infosys Certification out of 62000+ participants and been certified as Infosys Certified Software Programmer.
    Being interested in the open-source contribution We ran a club after college hours which involved nearly 50 students in developing real-time projects. I have been elected as President for the college FOSS club and recently selected as a  GitHub campus expert.
    My hobbies are watching movies, playing badminton, photography, and dancing.
    I'm much interested in developing real-time application development which serves people across the globe.
