### Introduction To Dart

Hello Geeks, you might be wondering what this DART is?
Dart is an open-source, general-purpose, client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build web, server, desktop, and mobile applications. Dart is an object-oriented, garbage-collected, class-based language with 'C' language style syntax. Dart can compile to either JavaScript or native code. It supports mixins,  interfaces, reified generics, abstract classes, and type inference.

### Why Dart?

- There are so many uses of Dart programming language. We can use it on the server, in mobile apps, in embedded devices, and compile it to JavaScript. Dart is a general-purpose, modern,  scalable programming language.
- Google uses Dart as an embedded runtime, such as on Google Fiber set-top boxes.
- Google uses Dart to build business-critical web apps, such as their Google Fiber's TV UI, internal sales tool, new versions of AdWords, and more.
- Google also uses Dart to power Flutter, a cross-platform mobile app Software Development Kit(SDK). Most websites are using AngularDart, including Google (AdWords and AdSense). Lots of code is being deployed server-side to publish websites. 
- Flutter (based on Dart) allows Android and iOS apps to be built from one codebase, with many advantages.

### Who uses Dart?

**Flutter**
The most popular Flutter toolkit depends on the Dart language. So developers writing code on Flutter apps for iOS, Android use Dart.
