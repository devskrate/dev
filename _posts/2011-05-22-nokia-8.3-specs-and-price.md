Camera wise this has 64MP main sensor. Actually we cannot judge the clarity of photos by the megapixels because the image quality not only depends in the megapixel but also the software. You can read our article on  Does Megapixels Matter? [here](https://devskrate.com/does-megapixels-matter-in-phone-camera/)

But, we can use Gcam for good photos and videos but also nokia camera also gives users more options in camera like pro mode with which we can make more of it.

#### Verdict 
The rumour says that the price may be around 45,000 rupees. But at this pice range it is not worthy because we get better. But if it is released at 25,000 price range it gives a good competition in the market. We can suggest you to buy this phone if it's price is around 25,000 rupees else 45K is not a good deal.
