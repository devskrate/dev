Finally Facebook had made the data transfer tool available to all over the globe through the [blog post](https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/data-portability-photo-transfer-tool/), which was earlier available only to to the Users in USA and Canada.

This data transfer tool allows you to create a copy of all the photos or videos on your Facebok account and transfer them to a linked Google Photos account. Earlier, this tool was made available to selected countries, is now available to everyone.

So, how to transfer your photos and videos? Here's the way:

**1.** Firstly, log into your Facebook account and click on the **down arrow** at the top end of the menu bar.

As of now, this tool can only transfer media to Google, but later expected to have multiple platforms as a part of the [Open Source Data Transfer Project](https://datatransferproject.dev/) formed by the alliance of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Twitter back in 2018.
