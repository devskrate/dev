GitHub introduced to display your profile as your choice using a markdown file. So, I have made mine and, if you have no idea about what I'm talking have a look at <a href="https://github.com/nikhilpyreddy" target="_blank">this</a>.

#### How to create:

- Firstly, create a repository with your `username`. Yay!! You made it.
- Then create it as **public**.
- Now create a new file named as **README.md**.
- In the README file you can create your profile with your preferences.
- If you want a template you can fork the my repository [here](https://github.com/nikhilpyreddy/nikhilpyreddy).
- And edit the readme file with your preferred details.
