As we all know, the biggest challenge in internet marketing is getting traffic to your website. However difficult it may be, it is a must if you want to be successful. You could pay for Google AdWords, and pray that your campaign doesn’t get slapped by Google, or you could spend a few extra minutes every day, and get a better listing with more traffic for free.

So how did I get my listing on the first page of Google?

I am going to show you in 5 simple steps.

Ok, here it goes:

**Step 1**
Create a blog – 10 minutes unless you already have a blog or website. Setting up a blog is very easy. Go to Blogger, register for a free Blogger account, choose a name for your blog (being very careful to give a name that applies to what you will be writing articles about), write your first post to introduce the blog, and then move on to step 2.

**Step 2**
Write an article or press release – 10-30 minutes depending on the length. Be careful not to “sell” anything in your article. You should be giving advice, reviewing a product, or something of that nature. Make sure you place a link to your blog at the end of the article in the bio box.

**Step 3**
Create a Title for your article and make sure that it is a popular phrase – one that will be searched for. You can use the free keyword tools for this. You want to search for your phrase using quotes (“), and look at the results number at the top right of the search results — if the results are under 5000, and there are people paying for ads using that search term (look for the sponsored listings on the right hand side), then chances are you have found a winner. Use that for the name of your article. Always write your article and save it to your computer, as you will want to submit it to more than one article directory. Copy/paste your article in to 4 or 5 free article submission sites, and then copy and paste it to your blog using the same title as the “Blog Post Title”. If you prefer to just link from your blog to the article, you can do that as well, but the idea is not just posting to article directories, it is adding “important” content to your blog. Once you have completed this step, move on to step 4.

**Step 4**
Many of the article submission sites allow you to use the “Add This” feature, which allows you to submit your article link to Social Networking Sites. Many online marketers are realizing the importance of doing this, so I would not skip this step.

**Step 5**
Search for your title in 24 hours and find it on the first page of Google.

Folks, it does not get any better than this. Imagine having 10-20 articles listed per month. Do you know how much traffic that would create? And to think that if you write good content, your articles could show up for months or years to come!

The great thing about this is that even if you have never written an article in your life, once you write one, and it gets listed by Google, you will be hooked. And don’t forget, you are getting all of this accomplished absolutely free.

Forget about all of the SEO, and maintaining a website. Choose your title wisely, and you will be successful.
