Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub
related that happens locally on your computer. This cheat sheet features the most important and commonly
used Git commands for easy reference.

### INSTALLATION & GUIS

With platform specific installers for Git, GitHub also provides the ease of staying up-to-date with the latest
releases of the command line tool while providing a graphical user interface for day-to-day interaction, review, and
repository synchronization.

### Git for All Platforms

## SETUP

Configuring user information used across all local repositories.

**git diff** &#8212;
diff of what is changed but not staged  
**git diff --staged** &#8212;
diff of what is staged but not yet commited  
**git commit -m “[descriptive message]”** &#8212;
commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot

## BRANCH & MERGE

Isolating work in branches, changing context, and integrating changes.  
**git branch** &#8212;
list your branches. a \* will appear next to the currently active branch  
**git branch [branch-name]** &#8212;
create a new branch at the current commit  
**git checkout** &#8212;
switch to another branch and check it out into your working directory  
**git merge [branch]** &#8212;
merge the specified branch’s history into the current one  
**git log** &#8212;
show all commits in the current branch’s history

## INSPECT & COMPARE

Examining logs, diffs and object information  
**git log** &#8212;
show the commit history for the currently active branch  
**git log branchB..branchA** &#8212;
show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB  
**git log --follow [file]** &#8212;
show the commits that changed file, even across renames  
**git diff branchB...branchA** &#8212;
show the diff of what is in branchA that is not in branchB  
**git show [SHA]** &#8212;
show any object in Git in human-readable format

## TRACKING PATH CHANGES

Versioning file removes and path changes.  
**git rm [file]** &#8212;

**git mv [existing-path][new-path]** &#8212;
change an existing file path and stage the move  
**git log --stat -M** &#8212;

**git fetch [alias]** &#8212;
fetch down all the branches from that Git remote  
**git merge [alias]/[branch]** &#8212;
merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date  
**git push [alias][branch]** &#8212;
Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch  
**git pull** &#8212;
fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

## REWRITE HISTORY

Rewriting branches, updating commits and clearing history  
**git rebase [branch]** &#8212;
apply any commits of current branch ahead of specified one  
**git reset --hard [commit]** &#8212;

## TEMPORARY COMMITS

Temporarily store modified, tracked files in order to change branches.  
**git stash** &#8212;

**git stash list** &#8212;
