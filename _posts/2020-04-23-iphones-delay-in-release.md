Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, In his new investor note, has outlined some information regarding the possible delay of the iPhone 12's production as well as the possible postponement of its much-rumored iPhone SE plus due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

#### iPhone 12 production:
In Kuo's note, He said that due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19, The Cupertino giant(Apple) had to do a lot of changes in its production, which lead to a one-month delay in engineering verification testing for the new iPhone 12 models.

The iPhone 12 lineup is expected to include four new models, and According to the analyst
the lower end models sized 6.1- inch and 5.4-inch iPhone will enter into the mass production in September
and the 6.7 inch which is expected to come with 5G support will enter not enter the production until October.
According to Kuo,this is because the 6.7-inch model has the most complicated design.

The above could mean that Apple will announce all the four iPhone models at once
but the release dates likely going to be different for each model due to the production delays.

#### iPhone SE Plus Delayed:

iPhone SE 2020 has sold more models than Apple expected and there were strong rumors
regarding a plus model of the iPhone SE and was confirmed by the evidences found in the IOS 14 code
however Kuo's note says that the iPhone SE Plus is likely to be delayed until Q2 2021.
