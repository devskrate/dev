Moto after 4 years has come back to making flagship phones with its new edge series, 
It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let's see what Motorola has to offer 
in this article.

#### Moto Edge Plus:
The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It's 
an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The 
edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in 
one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight 
megneta and solar black. Before 
taking a deep dive lets see the specs.

Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865
Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)
front Camera	25MP
Display	        6.7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD
5G support	both mm and sub-6 band.
Battery	        5000mAH(18W)
Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)
Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)
Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)
RAM/ROM         12GB/128or256GB

#### Display and battery:  
The display is a 6.7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in 
this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days.

#### Camera:
This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP 
Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video.The 
second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots.The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down to
camera software.

#### Software and Hardware:
Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it "My UX".In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing.
The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging 
and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones.

#### Pricing:
This phone is priced at 999.99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer.
If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k. 

#### Moto Edge:
Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It 
only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key 
difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board.This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other options
from vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience.    

Both these phones are expected to launch in India after the pandemic has ended,what do you think about these phones
