Being core **Python** and **Java** developers we extensively use VS Code for our project development and use code formatting heavily to enable consistency of code while developing as a team and there are lot of useful extensions which will help you to ease your task and run things on your fingertips.

### Why Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

Here are some Key Benefits of using VS Code -

- Available on Mac, Linux, and Ofcourse Windows.
- Edit, Build, and Debug very easily.
- Highly configurable - **Open-source project**
- VS Code also includes great tooling for web technologies such as NodeJS, JSX/React, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, and JSON.
- Highly robust and Extensible.
- High availability of industry and community-developed extensions.
- Much loved dark theme

- An extension with rich support for the Python language, including features such as linting, debugging, IntelliSense, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, unit tests, snippets, and more!

* I personally use **black** code-formatter. we can configure it in our workspace settings in **.vscode** file. This helps to maintain code and code-formatting consistent in development.
  - Troubleshoot the code formatting plugin in python [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing)

**2. Java Extension by Mircosoft** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

**3. Markdown Renderer Extension** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

- Markdown Preview Enhanced is an extension that provides you with many useful functionalities such as automatic scroll sync, math typesetting, mermaid, PlantUML, pandoc, PDF export, code chunk, presentation writer, etc.

**4. Prettier Extension for JavaScript** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

- It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

**5. ESLint** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

- This will be useful to check JavaScript and TypeScript errors
- The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running `npm install eslint` in the workspace folder for a local install or `npm install -g eslint` for a global install.

**6. CSS Peek** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)

![Markdown gif](https://devskrate.github.io/assets/images/vscode/css.gif)

- CSS Peek is a great tool if you keep forgetting what was a CSS class was used for. However, that could also mean that your CSS class names are not meaningful, or you have written too much "unmaintainable" code. Still, this is sure going to be handy if you are viewing/rewriting someone elseâ€™s code.

**7. Debugger for Chrome** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

![Markdown gif](https://devskrate.github.io/assets/images/vscode/chrome.gif)

- Debugger for Chrome is a great tool if you use a debugger in VSC. It allows you to launch an instance of Chrome navigated to your app, or it can attach to a running instance of Chrome. Using the URL parameter, you tell VSC which URL to either open or launch in Chrome.

**8. Gitlens** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

- GitLens supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.

**9. Git File History** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomber.git-file-history)

![Markdown gif](https://devskrate.github.io/assets/images/vscode/git-file-history.gif)

- This helps to quickly browse the history (edits and commits done by you and others) in a cool and interesting visualization.
- you can try this in browser also. you just need to do these three steps.
  1. Go to a file in GitHub (or GitLab, or Bitbucket)
  2. Replace github.com with github.githistory.xyz
  3. There's no step three. you'll love this.

**10. Docker Extension** - [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
