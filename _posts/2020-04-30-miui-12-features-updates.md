Xiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update.
Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It's a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let's see what features does this new UI brings to the table.

#### 1. UI changes:
Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.

</p>
	
The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.

</p>

#### 2. Wallpapers:
Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them 'Super Wallpapers' and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models of
earth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.

</p>

#### 3. Dark Mode 2.0:
You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what's new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called 'Wallpaper Dimming' feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers.)

#### 4. MI Health App:
Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI.This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer.

</p>

#### 5. Improved Gesture:
This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.

#### 6. Privacy enhancement:
Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System.
**Firstly**, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissions
and offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.

</p>
	
The **second** one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.

</p>
	
The **third** one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID's when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.
