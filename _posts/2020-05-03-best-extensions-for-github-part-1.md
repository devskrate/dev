#### 3. Git.Expandinizr- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githubexpandinizr/cbehdjjcilgnejbpnjhobkiiggkedfib)

Usually we do feel irritating when Github truncates the name of file or folder, to view full name we need to open that file. But with this extension this problem will be solved.

![truncate-demo](https://devskrate.github.io/assets/images/mlogs/github/truncate.webp)

Features

- Removes the truncating of file, directory names and notifications in the repository browser
- Really long file and directory names will word-wrap
- Fully expands the website, with breakpoints at 1400px, 1600px and 1800px

#### 4. File Icon for GitHub - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-icon-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/github-file-icon/?src=search)

On GitHub, no matter what kind of file is, their icons are all same. However, in your fancy editor, there are some packages which give every filetype an unique icon.

But this extension to replace original file icon with filetype-specific icons. This improves visual recognition on GitHub, GitLab, etc.

#### 5. Isometric Contributions -[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/isometric-contributions/mjoedlfflcchnleknnceiplgaeoegien/related), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/isometric-github/?src=search)

Based on GitHub contribution chart renders an isometric(3D) pixel view of GitHub contribution graphs.

This extension allows you to toggle between both the normal GitHub contribution chart and an isometric pixel art version.

Here is my github isometric contribution chart - **I'm loving it..**
