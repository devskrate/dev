Quite often we feel much irritating to shift from Dev Environment to Github and to back to Dev Environment.
**How would it be if there's a robust develop environment embedded in GitHub itself?**. Very soon Github will bring you the [Visual Studio Code](https://devskrate.com/configure-vscode-like-a-pro/) Development experience right in your GitHub within browser itself.

In order to configure your Github to make your work more productive add these extensions to your [browser](https://devskrate.com/best-extensions-for-github-part-1/).

Let's discuss why CodeSpaces will be much loved by developers..

#### What is CodeSpaces?

In a major announcement for developers, GitHub has launched CodeSpaces — a feature that lets you code directly on the web. It's like a virtual Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on the cloud.

> Codespaces can be configured to load your code and dependencies, developer tools, extensions, and dotfiles. Switching between environments is simple—you can navigate away at any time, and when you switch back, your codespace is automatically reopened.

#### Why Codespaces?

As the title says Codespaces is Your instant Dev Environment. you'll get the full Visual Studio Code experience without leaving GitHub.

Till now, to contribute to a project you would need to clone the repository, and set up the environment on your local machine according to the requirements of a project. This is the toughest part we've ever felt.
But with Codespaces, you don’t need to do this anymore. Just with a single click Github will setup the whole environment within seconds.

#### Key Features of CodeSpaces

###### 1. Code without compromise

You can code, build, test, debug, and deploy with a complete development environment in your browser. That too literally with a single click within seconds.

###### 2. Simplify your workflow

You can automatically set up dependencies and SSH keys. Go from code to commit faster on any project. This is one of the main advantage CodeSpaces will have.

###### 3. Extend and customize

As we said earlier Codespaces is your Visual Studio Code experience. you can install all the best [vscode extensions](https://devskrate.com/configure-vscode-like-a-pro/)

Github also provides dark mode for development environment. we are sure that you'll love working there.
With your development in the cloud, you can contribute code from any device, using VS Code or your browser.

Github supports all popular development programming languages support to make sure that you will have a great experience.
