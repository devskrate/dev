### What is Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador

The Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program is a global group of on-campus ambassadors who are eager to help students and their communities, lead in their local tech circles, and develop technical and career skills for the future. As a Student Ambassador, you might find yourself organizing a campus or community hackathon, mentoring other students.

Microsoft quoted the program as.....

> Looking for student leaders with a passion for making a difference, building vibrant communities, and sharing the latest tech with their peers.

### When did it all started?

The MSP Program was initiated back in **2001**, and operated in **15 countries** for five years. In late **2006**, the program was expanded to **50 countries** worldwide, and as of July 2010, there are more than **2800 members** worldwide across 101 countries and regions.

### Transformation from Student Partner to Learn Student Ambassador
