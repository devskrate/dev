These days companies everywhere find themselves quickly changing how they work. With the culture shift that comes along with remote work, it’s fair to say that collaboration is already starting to be different.

[GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/), always helps the next generation of developers to make their best in work. Now, more than ever, students need opportunities to sustain their growth. Github together with their partners **Major League Hacking (MLH)**, solving this problem with a new program—the **MLH Fellowship**, Powered by **GitHub**. This remote program matches up *pods* of 8-10 students with **open-source projects and mentors** over a period of 12 weeks. Students will receive a stipend for the program through **GitHub Sponsors**.

Not just GitHub, many other tech companies will come together and fuel this ecosystem. To kick off the program, GitHub Education plans to support **100 MLH Fellows** in the inaugural class of summer 2020. These are the other partners who're joining this coalition Facebook, DEV, and the Royal Bank of Canada.

This is how GitHub describes about MLH Fellowship

##### GitHub's vision: Workforce innovation to meet student demand

Enterprises want to stay competitive with recent graduates, and internship programs often provide that edge. Internships also serve as a credential: For future hiring managers, an internship with a top tech company is a good indication of a quality candidate.

But for students, many, many more of them apply for those coveted roles than there are positions to fill. For most students, a summer in Silicon Valley is often out of the question for those aspiring developers, maintainers, and engineering managers. In partnering with MLH, we’re looking to welcome a new global workforce that is trained in real-world workflows and collaboration

CEO of MLH, Mike Swift, points to the program’s design around remote work and public projects:

> Enabling students to spend their summer contributing to the software that runs the world is a unique     opportunity for them. They’ll work on meaningful projects with their peers under the guidance of some of the world’s most talented engineers. The remote nature of this program will democratize access to internships for countless students worldwide.

###### The opportunity: Shape the future of work
In this moment, companies have the opportunity to affect how we learn, collaborate, and share for decades to come. We hope to see the results of these particular efforts in as little as 12 months when this year’s group of interns graduate.

> Let’s keep education moving forward. Students, we got you. - GitHub
