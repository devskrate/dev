Here is an easier and more seamless way to work with GitHub from the command line — [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), currently it is in **beta**. Millions of developers rely on GitHub for software development to make it more fun and collaborative.
The tool `gh` brings the [GitHub](https://github.com/) experience right to your terminal.

#### Installation

You can install GitHub CLI today on most of the Operating Systems available -

- macOS
- Windows
- Linux

Install this from [here](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation-and-upgrading)

It’s available today for GitHub Team and Enterprise Cloud, but not yet available for GitHub Enterprise Server. This will have support support for Enterprise Server when it’s out of beta.

#### How to use?

`gh` currently suppports with `issues` and `pull requests` because many developers use them every day. Here are few examples provided by GitHub on how `gh` can improve your experience when contributing to an open source project.

- ##### Filter lists to your needs

  Find an open source project you want to contribute to and clone the repository. And then, to see where maintainers want community contributions, use `gh` to **filter the issues** to only show those with `help-wanted` labels.

- ##### Quickly view the details

  Find an **issue** describing a bug that seems like something you can fix, and use `gh` to quickly open it in the browser to get all the details you need to get started.

- ##### Create a pull request

  Create a **branch**, make several commits to fix the bug described in the issue, and use `gh` to create a _pull request_ to share your contribution. By using GitHub CLI to create _pull requests_, it also automatically creates a fork when you don’t already have one, and it pushes your branch and creates your _pull request_ to get your change merged

- ##### View the status of your work

  Get a quick snapshot the next morning of what happened since you created your _pull request_. `gh` shows the review and check **status** of your _pull requests_

- ##### Easily check out pull requests

  One of the maintainers reviewed your _pull request_ and requested changes. You probably switched branches since then, so use `gh` to checkout the _pull request_ branch. We never remember the right commands either! Make the changes, push them, and soon enough the pull request is merged—congratulations!
