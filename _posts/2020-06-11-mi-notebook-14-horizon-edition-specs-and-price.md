#### Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition:

Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition comes with an all-metal design made of aluminum and magnesium alloy and weighs just 1.35 kgs. Taking about the design, We think it looks classy with no branding on the outside. Talking about Biometric unlock, It does not come with any biometric unlock like the fingerprint or the face unlock, hell it doesn't even have a webcam built-in but at least they bundle an external HD webcam in the box.

One thing about the Mi Laptop that will stand out to you is the almost **bezel-less anti-glare LCD** with a screen to body ratio of 91 percent. It is a 14 inch IPS LCD display with bezels as thin as 3mm at the top and around the sides, as per the press release. The bottom bezel is slightly thicker to accommodate the Mi logo. It comes with 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. The panels comes with a 178-degree viewing angle and can go up to a peak brightness of 250 nits.

Talking about Internals, The laptop is powered by the **10th-Gen Intel Core Comet Lake processor**, You can either equip this with an i5-10210u or a much powerful i7-10510u. It is coupled with a with 8GB of DDR4 RAM and up to 512GB SSD storage. On the graphical side of things, it comes with a dedicated graphics card namely the Nvidia GeForce MX350 (2GB).

The standard Mi Notebook 14 has some considerable differences – both on the design and internals front. This laptop is a rebranded version of the RedmiBook 14 Pro, which debuted in China back last year.

The main differentiator is that it comes with a much thicker bezels when compared to the horizon edition but the panel is the same 14-inch Full-HD display with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 178-degree viewing angle, and 250 nits of peak brightness. Even though the bezels are thicker but still it doesn't have a built-in webcam, but at least they bundle an external HD webcam in the box.
Speaking of internals, You only comes with an i5 processor in this variant and it is coupled with 8GB 2666MHz RAM and up to 512GB SATA 3 SSD onboard. The graphic card is also changed it comes with an Nvidia GeForce MX250 instead of the MX350.

The ports, connectivity, battery, and other software feature are similar to that of the Horizon Edition.
