One Plus has once been known for its flagship killer smartphones and then as the time passed they started expanding into several other product lineups like a real flagship, Bluetooth earphones and many more and now one plus is planning to add to a new member to its family, a new true wireless buds.

The folks at XDA Developer have spotted several references about the TWS(‘true wireless stereo’) in the Android 11 beta code. This TWS can be named as One Plus Pods, but at this point, we are a bit skeptical.

There is also mention of 'oppoPodsService' in the code, which can mean that the companies will be sharing the technologies and we can expect to see some hardware lend from the Oppo Enco Free or the Enco W31. We can expect to see this product getting launched in two to three months alongside the One Plus’s mid-range phone One Plus Z.
