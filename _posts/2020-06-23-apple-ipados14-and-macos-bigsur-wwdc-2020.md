Apple released it's new iPadOS 14 and Mac OS Big Sur

#### iPad OS:

- iPadOS 14, the latest version of iPadOS brings everything that iOS 14 packs, with some major redesign to how the interface looks on iPad's large screens.
  Siri is also getting a makeover on the iPadOS, it's now a lesser space with only a small icon on the bottom right corner, much like the iOS.

- The ipadOS also borrows features like universal search from macOS, which also you to not only on your home screens but also on any app. The ipadOS also brought several features to productivity apps like photos, calendars and redesigned them to make use of the much bigger screen real-estate available.

- With this ipadOS update, Apple focused on making the already useful Apple Pencil much more useful. Apple Pencil now gets Scribble mode, which turns your scribbling into proper texts. This text can be copied and pasted anywhere.

- You can use scribble mode in the search menu as well. The iPadOS is getting a compact screen window for calls.The developer beta of iPadOS 14 is available today while the stable versions will launch this fall.

#### macOS:

Apple named its latest macOS as Big Sur. The biggest change is the new look. This is what Apple considers the biggest redesign after the introduction of macOS 10.

Like the ipadOS, macOS takes much of its queues from iOS, including a control center for customizing brightness, Do Not Disturb, and several other settings. It also adds a new notification center, which keeps all of your notifications and widgets. It also brings pinned messages and several other message feature to the mac's message app. Apple maps also have the same feature changes to that of iOS 14.

Big Sur also features improvements to its core applications. Safari now features a new start page with customizable background images and sections like Reading List and iCloud Tabs. It also adds Safari can now also detect when you're on a page with non-native language and offer to translate it for you similar to google translate on chrome.

The tab UI has also been changed with increased size and preview for tabs and the ability to close all the tabs which are right of the selected tab.

Apple also claims Safari to the faster browser. Apple has also improved extension support, which allows developers to bring in their extensions from other browsers, which can be found on the Mac App Store but they can only access your data once you allow them. Safari also shows which trackers are being blocked by the browser.

Apple also announced the Mac platform will now be transferred to ARM and apple will be making its own A-series custom chipsets and Apple promises to bring its first ARM-powered machine by the end of the year and the transition from Intel to ARM will take two years.
