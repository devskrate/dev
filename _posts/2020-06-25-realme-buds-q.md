The market for TWS in India is growing rapidly and to add for heat to the competition Realme has introduced the Realme Buds Q in India.

Realme Buds Q looks like a round pebble with rounded edges to the sides. The buds are super light, with each weighing at 3.6 grams each. The charging case is also quite pocketable and weighs 35.3 grams. Realme Buds Q comes with Bluetooth 5.0 for connectivity, but it doesn't have the support for Fast Pair.

Speaking of sound quality, it comes with a 10mm Bass Boost driver, which Realme says are the largest bass driver in the segment. It also has support for super low latency mode, which reduces the latency down to 119ms. It also comes with IPX4 water resistance to prevent sweat and rain from damaging the earbuds.

You can change the actions according to your preference from the Realme Link app. The company promises a total battery life of 20 hours of battery life, with the earbuds offering 4.5 hours of continuous playback on a single charge.
