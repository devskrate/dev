Realme earlier this year launched its X50 pro with Snapdragon 865 with 5G support, but in India 5G is not out yet and is expected any time soon, so they wanted to offer the best 4G phone at lower price to appeal to wider range of audience and released the Realme X3 and X3 superzoom. Realme X3 SuperZoom was first launched in Europe earlier last month while it is the first time that the company is talking about the regular Realme X3. Lets see what this phone has to offer.

#### Design and Display:

Talking about the design, it's a glass sandwich build which is held together by a plastic frame. It is protected by Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back. This phone comes with dual punch-hole cutouts to accommodate two cameras. Speaking of display it comes with 6.6 inch 120Hz IPS LCD panel, 120 Hz is good but would have loved to see Amoled instead of the IPS LCD. Since it is an LCD panel it comes with a side-mounted fingerprint scanner.
