OnePlus entered the Tv market in India with the Q1 smart TV in 2019 and the conclusion was that the Tv was good but it was a bit overpriced and in a market like India price matters a lot and OnePlus has realized it and plans to correct it with the launch of new U- series and Y-series range of smart TV.

### OnePlus TV U Series:

The rear comes with a brushed metal finish up-top and a carbon fiber cover at the bottom. The TV comes with a brand new remote with D-pad at the top, followed by an array of buttons including the Google Assistant, Netflix, Prime Video, volume rocker, and more.
