Microsoft has announced its Pylance extension for fast and feature-rich language support for Python on Visual Studio Code. Pylance depends on the existing <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python" target="_blank">Python extension</a> and builds up the experience.

### Optimized performance:

Pylance is a new language server for Python, which uses the Language Server Protocol to communicate with VS Code.

> The name Pylance serves as a nod to Monty Python’s Lancelot, who is the first knight to answer the bridgekeeper’s questions in the Holy Grail.

To improve user experience, Pylance is created as a brand-new language server based on Microsoft’s Pyright static type checking tool. Pylance leverages type stubs (.pyi files) and lazy type inferencing to provide a highly-performant development experience.
