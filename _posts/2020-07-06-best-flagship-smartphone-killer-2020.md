#### 4.USER INTERFACE:
Speaking of UI, three of them are running on  Android 10, but still end up offering a different experience and different set of features because of different skins they offer on top of android. One Plus offers OxygenOS, Realme offers Realme UI based on color OS and iQOO offers Monster UI based on FunTOuch OS. Our personal favorite is OxygenOS offered by OnePlus because it is closer to stock android with few to none bloatware.

#### 8.Verdict:
Speaking about the best phone, it entirely depends on the type of user you are if you want a smooth Android experience and regular android updates then One Plus 8 is the one for you. If you don't bother much about the updates but want the rest of the important features like 5G, 90Hz refresh rate then Realme X50 pro is the best option you got. If you want the power of SnapDragon 865 but don't care about 5G or the 90Hz Refresh rate then you can buy iQOO 3 at a much cheaper price.
