At the 43rd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries Limited, Jio has officially announced its rumored Jio TV+ service and it's setup box service in India.

The problem Jio TV+ is trying to solve is the discoverability of content, which has become very difficult with many OTT platforms, which have been fighting very hard to attract you to their services. The company plans to solve this problem by bringing all of the major OTT platforms under one single roof. 

Jio TV+ will be offering content over 12 leading global OTT players such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar, Voot, SonyLiv, Zee5, JioCinema, JioSaavn, YouTube and many other. This service will enable users to watch all your favorite tv shows, movies, songs, trailer, songs, and even music videos all under one roof.

Subscribers will not require to log-in to Netflix, Prime Video, or other OTT services separately to watch the content. They will be allowed to watch directly through the Jio Tv+ seamlessly without the need for an individual log-in ID.

The company is also planning to bring better search functionality in which users can find the content based on genres, actors, producers, directors, and mood.

The Jio Tv+ plus UI looks the same as the Apple TV+. This is not the first time, the company has done the same with Jio Meet is almost similar to the zoom.

Alongside JioTV+, The company also promised to change the Live TV industry, which is broadcaster dependent on a more interactive one with JioFiber. The company also said that through Jio App Store on the set-up box, users can access apps across genres like entertainment, education, health, cooking, gaming, religion, yoga, and many others.
