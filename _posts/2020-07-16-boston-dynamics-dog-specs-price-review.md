Spot, a four-legged robot made by Boston Dynamics is a nimble robot that climbs stairs and traverses rough terrain with unprecedented ease, yet is small enough to use indoors. Built to be a rugged and customizable platform, Spot has an industry track record in remote operation and autonomous sensing.

Spot has one of its first real-world assignments: oil and gas firm Aker BP will start using it to patrol a rig in the Skarv field in the Norwegian Sea this year.

**First idea of Spot:** Spot was first proposed way back **11 years ago** in 2009 at Boston Dynamics with now now had been way better and exceptionally well by 2020.

### Technology under the hood:

Spot goes where wheeled robots cannot, while carrying payloads with endurance far beyond aerial drones. With 360Â° vision and obstacle avoidance, the robot can be driven remotely or taught routes and actions to perform autonomous missions.

**Mobility:** Spot's legs keep the robot stable while it quickly navigates stairs and difficult terrain. Register additional payload weight and watch as the system automatically adapts to keep the robot moving smoothly.

**SPEED: 1.6m/s**  
**SLOPE: Â±30Â°**  
**STEP HEIGHT: 30 cm**

##### Perceptive:

Spotâ€™s built-in stereo cameras provide depth information to produce 3D point clouds, enabling the robot to map its surroundings and avoid obstacles.  
These cameras are primarily for the robot's own navigation but also provide the user with a live monochrome video feed that can be streamed through the control tablet or over the API.

**FOV: 360Â°**  
**RANGE: 4m**  
**STREAM: Monochrome**

##### Autonomous:

Spot autonomously navigates over or around obstacles in its path using the real-time mapping conducted by the perception system. Spot also comes equipped with Autowalk, an easy-to-use tablet feature that allows users to record and replay autonomous missions.

**RUNTIME: 90 mins**  
**BATTERY: Swappable**

##### Customizable:

Spot can be tailored for a variety of applications. Select a Boston Dynamics or third-party payload, or design your own using our hardware and software development kits.

### Developer Platform

Developers can create custom methods of controlling Spot, program autonomous missions, design payloads to expand the robot's capabilities, and integrate sensor information into data analysis tools. Spot's mounting rails, payload ports, and software development kit give customers the tools they need to customize the robot for their application.

##### Teleoperation Application:

Program your own application and design a custom UI to control Spot remotely and see through Spot's cameras in real-time. Send commands like body posing, velocity, and direction to the robot.

##### Autonomous Route:

Developer can record maps and create your own missions with behavior trees by programming actions associated with specific points on the map. Later, use those missions to autonomously navigate your planned routes.

##### Data Pipeline:

Process critical data in real-time and trigger actions using intelligent models created by our AI partners.
