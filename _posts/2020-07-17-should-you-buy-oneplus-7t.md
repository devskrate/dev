You've already got everything about the two phones and OnePlus 8 and 7T have a whole _lot_ in common.

From hardware perspective, with the OnePlus 8 making a few minor improvements in areas like the display, battery, storage options, and of course, 5G support. The only perk is that OnePlus 8 is that, it is packed with a more energy efficient processor making its battery life a whole lot improved.

But the whole lot of caviar comes here as OnePlus 7T already has a decent full-day battery life and in a country like India where 5G is mere dream until the end of 2022. Also OnePlus 7T had a advantage of ultra wide camera for beautiful and wide angled photos.

**Final Verdict:** For a massive **₹10,000 price difference** sacrificing those little perks, it worth buying OnePlus 7T over OnePlus 8.
