Nowadays, smartphones are getting packed with more and more gigs of memory. As a user you will get this question - **How much RAM do you really use and how much is actually necessary for smooth usage?**

In this article, we take a look at these questions and provide some important answers so that you can learn more about how much memory is actually needed in a smartphone.

These days 6GB of RAM became more common and Every Flagship comes with 8 Gigs of RAM, Suprisingly Asus and Lenovo are bringing 12 and 16GB  to mobile phones although they're clearly meant for gaming, But **Do we need 8 Gigs of RAM for an occassional gaming user?**

Before we go to actual topic, Let's take a second to understand what is RAM? 

RAM stands for `Random Access Memory`. In a nutshell, it's an extremely fast component that temporarily stores all the information a device needs right now and in the near future. RAM is much faster than standard internal memory, so if you use apps frequently, the data for those apps will be stored in the RAM.

The more RAM you have on a smartphone, the more apps and files you'll be able to fit in the RAM, which means more apps will boot up quicker. Because of the optimisations made to mobile apps in general, there's a limit to how much RAM is actually needed.


#### RAM used by Android OS

Even you have 4 or 8 GB of RAM, Android OS requires not morethan 2GB, So where does left 6GB RAM goes?
Also you'll have GPU in your mobile, Adreno GPUs are very common in smartphones now a days. 
You may have high RAM usage apps like PUBG Mobile, Fortnite, Call of Duty. But do they need 6GB of RAM? 

#### Average RAM usage of most popular games in Android - 

{:class="table table-bordered dark"}
|Application    | RAM Usage  | Max RAM Usage | Download Size | Android OS |
| -----------      | ------------------| -----------------| -----------------| -------------| 
|PUBG Mobile      | Around 2GB   | 3GB |  2.3GB | Android 5 or above |
|Call of Duty Mobile       | Around 1.6GB   | 2.5GB| ~2GB | Android 5 above|
|PUBG Lite      | Around 1GB  |  1.5GB| ~500MB | Android 4.1 above|
|Fortnite          | Around 3GB |  3.5GB | ~3GB | Android 8 or above |

All other social media applications and common utility apps will take maximum of 1 to 2 GB of RAM, if you open all apps at a time. But usually we dont do that.

You may got some idea that you actually don't need 8 Gigs of RAM.

#### Does more RAM means Future ready phone?

Some may say that havig more RAM makes your phone future ready, But you need to know that hardware of a smartphone degrades gradually and on average we change phones for every three years according to latest survey resulsts.

> Smartphone companies are keeping more RAM  just for the sake of Bechmark Tests, But actual usage will be far different than a Benchmark test.

#### Here are 9 reasons why you don't need an 8GB RAM smartphone -


1. You don't even use 6GB of RAM anytime, except  when you run **benchmark tests**.
2. Games and Apps are designed in a way that they will consume less RAM.
3. Smartphones are keeping more RAM just for benchmark score sake
4. 8  Gigs of RAM will cost you more, Why will you spend on unneccasary things?
5. 8GB RAM phone might be ‘future-proof’, but most of us will change our phones anyways, as discussed before.
