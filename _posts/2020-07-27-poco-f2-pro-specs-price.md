#### Design and Build Quality:
The massive notch of the F1 is replaced by a fullscreen bezel-less experience on the front and
has an in-display fingerprint sensor on the front as well. The rear panel has a circular camera array and Poco branding, which is beautiful to look at. Both the front and back are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5.

#### Display:
This phone now comes with a glass sandwitch design put together by an aluminum frame, which is way superior compared to the polycarbonate build its predecessor(Poco F1) comes with. This phone comes with a 6.67-inch Full-HD+ AMOLED display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. We are disappointed to see a 60Hz display in 2020 but at least it comes with 180Hz touch sampling rate and a peak brightness close to 1200nits. This display also brings with it support for HDR 10+. We can also set different color types like Enhanced, Original, P3, sRGB.

#### Camera:
The F2 Pro comes with a quad-camera array in the circular cutout on the rear. The primary sensor is the 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor, along with a 13MP (f/2.4) ultra-wide-angle lens with 123-degree FOV, a 5MP telephoto macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor. The phone also supports 8k video capture. On the selfie side of things it comes with a 20MP pop-up camera with support for slow-motion video and other cool features. We think the pop-up cameras are not the one everyone liked.

#### Connectivity:
This phone comes with the top of the line snapdragon 865 with support for WIFI 6,5G. This phone also supports super Bluetooth,NFC, GPS. It also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top which is rear to see in flagships nowadays.Poco also includes an IR blaster to let you control home appliances.

#### Hardware and Software:
This phone is powered by top of the line Qualcomm's snapdragon 865. This also has Liquid cooling 2.0 to help the phone sustain high performance for longer periods and coming to software set if things, It runs MIUI 11 for Poco which is based on Android 10 out of the box. The feature offered by the Poco launcher is exactly similar to MIUI 11. The only difference is that this launcher offers a clutter-free app drawer. It will also get MIUI 14.

#### Battery & Charging:
This phone comes with a huge 4,700 mAh battery and support for 30W fast charging, which promises to top up the entire phone in 63 minutes. We are not sure about the wireless charging as of now.

#### Pricing:
This phone comes in two configurations – 6GB+128GB and 8GB+256GB and has been priced starting at 499 euros (around Rs. 40,750). You will need to shell out 599 euros (around Rs. 48,900) for
the 8GB+256GB variant.

#### Opinion:
We think that the phone is overpriced for what it brings on board with it. We are really hoping for real poco series not the rebranded versions of redmi series. We really enjoyed poco F1 and we want the fire of POCO in it's successors also.upto MIUI 14
