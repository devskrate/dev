With the huge success of the pixel 3a last year all the major companies have also started focusing on making a premium mid-range smartphone and now the market has a lot of competition in the premium mid-range market from the likes of iPhone SE, OnePlus Nord, and Google's Pixel 4a, let's compare and find out which suits you the best.
#### Build and Design:
Comparing the three build wise, the iPhone SE comes with the best built of the three with a glass-sandwich design which is holden together by a metal frame and also come with an IP rating while the Nord comes with glass back but only comes with a plastic frame and Pixel is a total plastic build. Speaking of design, This is iPhone falls a little short with the huge bezels and the Nord, Pixel comes with a bezel-less design and dual and single punch hole respectively. 
#### Display:
The display quality is where Pixel shines the most with its 5.81 inches  OLED screen with an FHD resolution, while the Nord comes with a 6.44 inches AMOLED display with an FHD resolution and SE with an IPS LCD Display with just above HD+ resolution.
#### Internals:
This is where the iPhone has an edge over the others with its A13 Bionic chipset, while Nord comes with Snapdragon 765G and Pixel is powered by Snapdragon 730G. Speaking of storage speeds, iPhone uses NVMe while both the Nord and Pixel uses UFS 2.1 storage.
#### Software:
iPhone comes with iOS 13 while the Nord comes with Oxygen OS based on Android 10 and Pixel comes with Pixel Experience based on Android 10 as well. Software we think is something that depends on your individual choice, but the main difference between iOS and Android is that Android offers better customization while iOS comes with better privacy features.
#### Battery And Charging:
Speaking of battery capacity, This is very Nord bets the rest with a 4115 mAh battery while the Pixel comes with a  3140 mAh battery and iPhone makes it even worst with its 3140 mAh battery. Speaking of charging speeds, here also Nord takes the lead with its 30W Warp charging while pixel and iPhone come with 18W fast charge support but the fact that the iPhone only comes with a 5W charger is a bit bothering.
#### Photography:
Speaking of photos, this where Pixel is the does the best with its 12.2MP rear and 8MP front camera and by bring over the same cool features like astrophotography, night mode, etc from the Pixel 4 and we are confident to say that if you are a person who likes to shoot a lot of photo pixel is the way to go, iPhone comes in second with its 12MP rear and 8MP selfie camera, it also does cool human portraits and close to reality photographers and Nord comes with a quad-rear camera, the primary sensor is a 48 MP f/1.7 Sony IMX586 with OIS. The second one is an 8 MP ultrawide lens with 119-degree field of view. The third is a 5MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. On the selfie side, the phone comes with a dual-camera setup, the main is a 32MP, while the second is an 8MP ultra-wide sensor with a 105- degree field of view, since it has multiple lens it can capture photos in different perspectives
omes with a quad-rear camera, the primary sensor is a 48 MP f/1.7 Sony IMX586 with OIS. The second one is an 8 MP ultrawide lens with 119-degree field of view.

#### Video:
Speaking of video, iPhone is the best in terms of focus, detail and we can say that if you are someone who shoots a lot of video then go for the iPhone. Pixel comes right after the phone with its good stabilized video and finally, Nord which can shoot video in different perspectives because of its multiple lenses.
#### Price:
The iPhone SE in India starts at Rs 47,800 while the Nord price starts at Rs 24,999 and finally Pixel which Google promises to bring to India at some point in time and rumors suggests a price at around Rs 32,000.
#### Verdict:
If you are someone who needs the best specs and don't really care of gaming and camera they go for the Nord, if you are someone who shoots photo regularly and don't bother having a smaller screen then you can wait for the Pixel 4a and finally if you want to try out the ios, shoot videos regularly and want a compact phone then go for iPhone SE but if you are someone who don't need a smaller screen then buy the iPhone XR since it almost offers the same feature and a better battery and a bigger display and in India, it is priced almost similar to the iPhone SE.
