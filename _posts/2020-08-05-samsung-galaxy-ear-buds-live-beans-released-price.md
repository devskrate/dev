Samsung released it's samsung galaxy buds live which are of bean shaped today! These TWS are leaked and the photos are in twitter from months!

Like Apple's standard AirPods, the Galaxy Buds Live have an open design, which means they nestle in your ear and don't require you to jam an ear tip in your ear canal.

Samsung calls this type of noise cancellation "ANC for Open Type". You need to have a tight seal to get good noise canceling, so it will be interesting to see how effective it actually is.

There’s no "ambient sound" mode on these earbuds because you’ll have no trouble hearing someone talking next to you or an important announcement at the terminal. Not everyone will like that, but if you want more isolation, that’s where the Buds Plus and their sealed-off design come in.
