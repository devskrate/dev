Since instagram has over **a billion** monthly active users, it's a great way to keep track of what's happening inlife of people you follow. As soon as you view one's story, the user also cn have a list of people viewing them. But here comes the idea to view stories annonymously. You can also do it by creating an annonymous account, but the user can track the name. So here are some of the apps and sites to view instagram stories without any account.

#### 1. Story Stalker:

Unlike many other apps on Google Play Store, Sory Stalker doesn't require you to login through your account. You can amintain your Stalk list and Follow list to view the stories. You can simply add any number of people in the stalk list and tap on the name to view their stories just like you do on Instagram.  
The second tab which is the Follow list feature, lets you see the stories of people on your list anonymously. The only catch is that you need to sign-in with your Instagram account in the app. This way it syncs all the people you follow on Insta, making it easy to view their story anonymously within the app. Thanks to the developer, the UI is minimal and good looking.

Get Story Stalker for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appvoy.storystalker&hl=en_IN" target="_blank">Android</a>.

#### 2. MyStalk:

MyStalk is a website that lets you see any public Insta profile easily. Simply open your mobile browser and head to Mystalk. You will see the search bar right at the top which you can use to feed in the username of the Instagram account you want to check.

Since, MyStalk is a website, it is very convinient for users to view from any platform. But to get rid of those hefty ads, an ad-blicker is recommended.

###### Pros:

- Support Hashtag searches
- Tap and hold to download content

###### Cons:

- Too many ads
