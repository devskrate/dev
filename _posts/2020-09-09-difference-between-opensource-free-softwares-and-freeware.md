+ Open-source
+ Free software/ Libre software
+ Freeware software - Generally everyone refers as Free software

### Open-source software:
Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the holder grants users the rights to 
+ use
+ study
+ change
+ distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.

There are many liscenses under open-source, so all the open-source softwares need not to be free.

**Eg**: Firefox, Linux etc..

### Free software/ Libre software:
Free software (or libre software) is a software that is available freely to users at no cost and it is open-source.

"Free software" means software that respects users' __freedom__ and __community__. 
Roughly, it means that **the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software**.

Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.

>  To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”.

There are 4 principles for free software.

+ Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
+ Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
+ Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute and make copies so you can help your neighbour.
+ Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

**All Free softwares are open-source, but all open-source softwares are need not to be Free**

**Eg**: Firefox, Linux, Debian, Gnome etc..


### Freeware / Free Software:

Freeware is software, most often proprietary, that is distributed at no monetary cost to the end user.
+ Unlike with free and open-source software, which are also often distributed free of charge, the source code for freeware is typically not made available.

These are technically reffered as **Freeware**.

**Eg**: Google Chrome, many free apps that you download from Playstore and Appstore.
