Apple has announced Apple watch series 6 and Apple watch SE.

+ Apple Watch Series 6 comes with an improved always-on display, much better than the previous generation. The watch comes with various watch faces including GMT, countdown, memoji face, among many others. Apple has introduced Family Set, this will help you setup your kid's Apple Watch using your iPhone. The new Apple Watch comes with 10 sports mode.
