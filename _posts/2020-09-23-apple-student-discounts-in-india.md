Apple is offering great discounts to students in India. 

Here are some of the offers for Mac Books that you get as a student.

If you observe the price difference you are getting around Rs.10,000/- discount and greater on the iMac Pro Desktop and for some others.

Here are the discounts with iPads as a student.

If you observe we get some good deals with the Mac Books, but coming to the iPad's they are not that great deal. We only get a discount from Rs.1000 to Rs.4000/-. Ofcourse according to the price they have given discounts.

> But, sadly under this offer we only get discounts on MacBook and iPad's but on any other Apple products :(.

+ For availing the discounts go to this [apple site](https://www.apple.com/in/shop/campaigns/education-pricing) and follow the instructions.
