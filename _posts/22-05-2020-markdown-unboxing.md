### Introduction To Markdown

Hello Geeks, you might be wondering what this Markdown language is? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. It is the creation of John Gruber, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks(*) before and after it. It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG editors.

### Why should we use Markdown?

There are a couple of reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

- Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Markdown is everywhere. Websites like GitHub and Reddit support Markdown and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it. 
- Markdown is platform-independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
- Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
- Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
