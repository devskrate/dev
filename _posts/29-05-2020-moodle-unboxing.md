It is suitable for all ages and all sectors. Anywhere learning takes place, Moodle can be used. It is usually used online but may also be used on an 'intranet' within your organization. Moodle is used for distance education, blended learning, flipped classroom, and e-learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces, and other sectors.
