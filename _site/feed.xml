Deno is the creation of Ryan Dahl, which is a new JavaScript runtime for the backend, but instead of being written in C++, it’s written in Rust, based on the Tokio platform (which provides the asynchronous runtime needed by JavaScript), running on Google’s V8 engine. It is also a new runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. 


#### Why should we use this?   

Generally we may get a doubt, why should I use it, here are some of it's features. They are:

##### 1. Security is integrated

Node.js allows you to access read and write into the filesystem, access environment variables, make outgoing requests, etc. As well as it also opens up a security risk if you are not careful when writing code.

So instead, Deno uses command-line arguments to enable or disable access to different security features. So if you need your script to be able to access the /etc folder, you can do:
 
```sh
deno --allow-read=/etc myscript.ts
```
It will allow your code to read from the folder, anything else and you’ll get a security exception. This is similar to how other platforms handle security. 

##### 2. Complete standard library

Deno claims to have a complete standard library allowing developers to use official tools to perform basic tasks and only requiring the use of external libraries for complex tasks and it comes with the tools to add color to terminal text, generate UUIDs, work with external data structures,  and for writing WebSockets.

##### 3. Integrated Typescript

In Deno, by default the integration into JavaScript is done internally, so no need for external tooling. By default Deno takes care of a lot, you can overwrite the configuration by using your own tsconfig.json file:

```sh
deno run -c tsconfig.json [your-script.ts]
```
The default configuration of Deno is to use strict mode, so any ill-advised coding practice will be alerted immediately.


#### Deno Installation

Deno ships as a single executable with no dependencies. You can install it using the installers below: 

##### Using Shell (macOS, Linux):
```sh
$ curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```
##### Using PowerShell (Windows):
```sh
$ iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```
##### Using Cargo (Windows, macOS, Linux):
```sh
$ cargo install deno
```
##### Using Homebrew (macOS):
```sh
$ brew install deno
```
##### Using Chocolatey (Windows):
```sh
$ choco install deno
```
##### Using Scoop (Windows):
```sh
$ scoop install deno
```

Designed for business and education, Teams includes group chat, video calling and collaboration tools, and has seen a spike in usage since countries and states have started directing residents to stay and work from home when possible to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.

With the update to Microsoft's collaboration tool, you can now pick a custom image as your video chat background. The Zoom video chat service also lets you pick your own custom background images for calls. But with recent concerns about Zoom security, some users are starting to look to other services such as Teams for their chats.

## How to change your video chat background in Microsoft Teams

Important catch: This feature is only available for scheduled meetings, according to Microsoft. 

1. Start or or join a Teams meeting, from the Windows or Mac application (you can't change your background on the web app at this point). 

2. At the bottom of the screen, click or tap the three dots to go to your Meeting controls.

3. Select More actions &gt; Show background effects. Either select Blur to blur your background, or choose from the available images to replace it. 

4. You'll be able to preview your background to see how it looks. If you like it, hit Apply. That's it!

In the future, you'll also be able to create your own images, upload them to Teams, and then select them as a background image for your video chats, reports said.

You can have video chats with up to 250 people in Microsoft Teams, and if your workplace or school has access to Office 365, you already have access to it. You can also check out a free version of Microsoft's communication tool.</content><author><name>nikhil</name></author><category term="meetings" /><category term="lockdown" /><category term="video calls" /><summary type="html">You can finally add your own background to Microsoft Teams video chats.

Xiaomi Announces MIUI 12, Here is a quick overview and list of phones which is expected to get this update.
Xiaomi in its recent keynote along with its phone announcement, it also the latest version of its software skin MIUI 12. It's a slight redesign of its exciting MIUI 11 and has quite a lot of visual changes. Let's see what features does this new UI brings to the table.

**1. UI changes**:
Xiaomi has been working hard to make their UI as refined and as minimal as possible. One of the UI changes comes in the notification shade, now we change some simple basic settings like wifi, Bluetooth in the notification shade itself with a tiny window and talking about looks, it looks much similar to control center found on the IOS.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-control-center.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The use of pictorial images to represent the status and data visualization ends up bringing a fresh look to the UI and the app animation(Opening and Closing) has also gotten much smoother.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-animation.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**2. Wallpapers**:
Wallpapers are one of the biggest visual changes and Xiaomi is calling them 'Super Wallpapers' and they look very cool, their live wallpapers which are based on high precision 3D models of
earth and mars and the fact that they turn into night scene when dark mode is added is a bounce. The live wallpapers feature for now is only exclusive to High-End Xiaomi phones.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-wallpapers.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**3. Dark Mode 2.0**:
You might ask me that we already have a system-wide dark theme in MIUI 11 so what's new in this, There are a good number of improvements in it. This time the company has worked to improve the readability to reduce eye strain and the text is now brighter and sharper. Dark mode also brings a new feature called 'Wallpaper Dimming' feature that will dynamically adjust the color temperature of your wallpaper(It also supports this feature for custom wallpapers.)

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-dark-mode.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**4. MI Health App**:
Mi Health debuts in this new version of MIUI.This enables, The phone can track users steps, sleep, workouts, and other exercises but the fact that to enable the phone to do sleep tracking the phone should be in the same pillow is a bummer. 

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-health-app.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**5. Improved Gesture**:
This UI update also brings with it a slight improvement in the gestures. It now has a much lengthy bar at the bottom and much refined animations to go along with it.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-gestures.gif&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**6. Privacy enhancement**:
Xiaomi this time along has followed a three-pronged approach to improve privacy in MIUI 12, namely Flare, Barbed Wire, and the Mask System.
**Firstly**, the flare will keep track of the app behavior of all apps on your phone and will present you the list of apps that may be violating the privacy policy or misusing permissions
and offer tips to avoid the above mishaps.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Flare privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-flare.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **second** one is Barbed Wire, in which it offers several permission options similar to Android 10 and gives us options like for permanently allow or only when app is in use or allow only once and it even shows the icon of which app is using what services.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Barbed privacy image&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-barbed.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
	
The **third** one is the Mask system which lets users to create and share virtual ID's when apps ask about the data, we saw a similar implementation in the Color OS 7 skin as well.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img width=&quot;27%&quot; alt=&quot;Mask&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-privacy-virtual-id.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**7. Floating window**:
Android 10 itself has the floating window feature, MI included  it to miui.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Floating window&quot; width=&quot;55%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-floating-window.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**8. Ads**:
Talking about the Ad situation in MIUI only time has the answer.

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img alt=&quot;Ads&quot; width=&quot;30%&quot; src=&quot;{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/mi/miui12-ads.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

**9. AI :**
AI feature is only available to china at present.

These are some of the important features coming to Xiaomi devices through MIUI 12 update.

Meta tags are the things which will do these things. 
The minimal way of creating the meta tags are
``` html
&lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Tech news&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;Devs, Krate, DevsKrate, Tech&quot;&gt;
&lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;Puneeth&quot;&gt;
```

The below are [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/), which enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph(mainly used by social media).
``` html
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;Generating Preview Links&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;article&quot; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;https://DevsKrate.com&quot; /&gt;

&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;A tech website for developers, where you get everything about tech&quot; /&gt; 
```

Twitter uses open graph, but for gettings previews in the cards and to be more specific, twitter has it's own meta tags. You can see how your preview works in twitter at [&quot;Twitter link preview&quot;](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)

Booting problems like bootloop(Restarting when ubuntu is selected) or blank screen after selecting ubuntu in the grub.

With My experience, I am giving here few fixes you may try.

**1. Uncheck the PPT security in BIOS**

Firstly goto the BIOS (It depends on the system, for Dell press F12), then goto security, then goto PTT security and Uncheck it.
```
Security -&gt; PTT Security and uncheck PTT On
```
Click Apply (I would recommend choosing Save as Custom User Settings), then OK, then Exit.

This should acctuallly work. If this does not work, try the second method.

**2. Boot from Advanced Options**

While booting from grub, you can see &quot;Advanced Options for Ubuntu&quot;. Select it and in that boot from the Old Kernel.
You may find many things like 
- Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic
- Ubuntu, with Linux 5.4-generic (recovery mode)
- Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic
- Ubuntu, with Linux 4.*-generic (recovery mode)

Boot with Linux 4.*-generic, don't boot with recovery or any other options availabe additionally.
Now, you will boot into Ubuntu:).

Remember, this method is not a permanent fix, you can use Ubuntu inthis way as long as you find the permanent fix, this will not do anything from accessing all the features.

**Additional Info**: Why method 2 is not a permanent fix, because Ubuntu uses Linux kernel 5.4, so grub will boot from it by default.

The iPhone 12 lineup is expected to include four new models, and According to the analyst
the lower end models sized 6.1- inch and 5.4-inch iPhone will enter into the mass production in September

It launched two phones namely Moto Edge and Moto Edge Plus. Let's see what Motorola has to offer 
in this article.

# Moto Edge Plus:
The standout feature of this phone has to be its design, It's 
an all-glass display with metal frame holding them together, The 
edges wrap around the edges with a punch hole at the top and in 
one word it looks gorgeous with two color variants to offer namely midnight 
megneta and solar black. Before 
taking a deep dive lets see the specs.

Processor:	Qualcomm Snapdragon 865
Rear Camera	Triple Cameras 108MP(with OIS) + 16MP(Ultra Wide + Macro) + 8MP(3x Zoom with OIS)
front Camera	25MP
Display	        6.7 inches 90HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio: 21:9) FHD
5G support	both mm and sub-6 band.
Battery	        5000mAH(18W)
Fingerprint	In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)
Water Resistant	Water Resistant(IP 68)
Charging	Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 15W) + 5W(Reverse Wireless Charging)
RAM/ROM         12GB/128or256GB

# Display and battery:  
The display is a 6.7 inch AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the phone comes with a 90HZ refresh rate but the resolution is only FHD(1080p), which is a bummer at this price point but it helps increase the battery efficiency and in 
this phone moto has provided a huge 5000mAh battery and moto claims it can last till 2 days.

# Camera:
This phone comes with a total of four cameras three at the back and one inside the punch hole. The primary sensor is a 108MP 
Samsung sensor which we saw in the galaxy s20 ultra, This camera by default shoots at 27MP and it has OIS built-in for stable video.The 
second sensory is an 8MP three times zoom sensor and this also has OIS for better video as well as zoom. The third is a 16MP Ultra wide sensor to capture ultra-wide shots.The selfie camera is a 25MP shooter. This phone has all the hardware required for a good camera it ultimately comes down to
camera software.

# Software and Hardware:
Talking about software, It comes with an almost stock-like experience with a few added features based on android 10, and moto is calling it &quot;My UX&quot;.In days where flagship smartphones are removing the headphone jack moto has it in this phone which is a great thing.
The hardware also is top end with snapdragon 865, It also supports fast charging, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging 
and all other high-end features to compete against the top of galaxies and iPhones.

# Pricing:
This phone is priced at 999.99 dollars which converts to around 75k price, which is very expensive considering what this phone has to offer.
If moto really wants to bring this phone to India it has to reduce the price to somewhere around 55k. 

# Moto Edge:
Edge is very similar to Edge plus with very few changes. The main shooter is 64MP instead of 108MP, the battery capacity is 4500mAH instead of 5000mAH, It 
only offers 4GB/6GB of RAM and it does not support any kind of wireless and reverse wireless charging on it but the key 
difference is that it comes with snapdragon 765 5G on board.This phone is priced at 699 EURO, which is 58,000 rupees. I think this phone is fairly overpriced and at this price we can get several other options
from vendors like one plus, Xiaomi, etc, which can offer us a flagship experience.

With this phone one plus is trying 
to tick all the boxes of a flagship. Did it succeed, let's see in the article below.

**Before taking a deep dive into the phones, let's see what specs this phone has to offer:**

{:class=&quot;table table-bordered dark&quot;}
|Name            | Specifications                                                            |
| -----------    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
|Processor       | Qualcomm Snapdragon 865                                                   |
|Rear Camera     | Quad Cameras 48MP(f/178) + 48MP(Ultra Wide) + 8MP(3x Zoom) + 5MP(Color Sensor)  |
|front Camera    | 16MP                                                                      |
|Display         | 6.78 inches 120HZ AMOLED(Aspect ratio:19.8:9)                             |
|Connectivity    | 5G, WIFI 6 Support                                                         |
|Battery         | 4510mAH(30T warp charging)                                                |
|Fingerprint     | In-Display Fingerprint Sensor(Optical)                                    |
|Water Resistant | Water Resistant(IP 68)                                                    |
|Charging        | Type-C cable + Wireless Charging(Upto 30W) + 3W(Reverse Wireless Charging)|

If you have carefully observed the specs, this phone includes an IP Rating as well as wireless charging.
This shows that one plus is not trying to cut corners against the best of samsung and apple but instead giving it all to take them head on.

* The phone pricing in India is not out yet but if we consider the US pricing which is 899$ 
converting it into INR we can estimate the price to be at around 68k with this price it 
still manages to undercut the iphone 11 and galaxy s20.

* Talking about the design, it has a single punch hole curved display similar to galaxy s10.
* The highlight of this phone has to be its **120Hz AMOLED** display which DisplayMate rated as an A+ display.(For people who are unaware of DisplayMate its like DXO Mark for Displays).

![2020 oneplus 8 ]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-front.jpg)

* Coming to the camera its a quad camera setup and on paper can take on the other flagships nicely.
* The Build quality with its glass body attached together by a metal has always been good but this time it also added dust and water resistance which is rated as IP 68(fit enough to withstand dust, dirt and sand and are resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater for up to thirty minutes).

![2020 oneplus 8 ]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/images/oneplus/oneplus8-pro-f-b.jpg)

* Taking about battery life, this phone comes with a 4510mAH capacity which is fairly good enough.

The performance is also great coming with snapdragon 865 processor.
This phone also supports 5G and WIFI 6 making it a future proof phone. The software thats the oxygen OS gives the cleanest andriod experience.

**Conclusion**: One Plus ended up making a really appealing flagship smartphone undercutting the likes samsung and apple by a good margin and offering way more specifications at this price point.</content><author><name>mohit</name></author><category term="oneplus" /><category term="android" /><category term="google" /><summary type="html">It has been 6 years since one plus has been making smartphones until last year the company has produced a lot of flagship killer but the company from the past year has changed its strategy to produce a true flagship with its one plus 7 pro and 7t pro they were good but lacked the bells and whistles that a true flagship from samsung and apple had.
